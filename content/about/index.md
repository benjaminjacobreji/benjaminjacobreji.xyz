## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love to sleep and drink coffee when Iâ€™m awake.

My hobby? coding and trying to make cool stuff.

I have made a self-driving car that actually followed traffic signals and stop signs.

Another project I did was controlling Tello drone using my limbs, it was pretty cool xD

Iâ€™ll update this page and add my projects later.

Have a great day!
